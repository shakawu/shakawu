# Hello Everyone!
My name is [Shafwan Khairullah](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shafwan-khairullah) but you can call me Awan. I am a student at [Caltex Riau Polytechnic](https://pcr.ac.id) in the Computer Engineering Technology Study Program.

I have a keen interest in Machine Learning, DevOps, Network Security, and IoT. Therefore, this GitHub will contain projects and programming language learning that I have done.

Besides studying, I have other hobbies such as running, going to the gym, reading books, listening to music, and even watching anime.

Arima Kana is my favorite character <3
